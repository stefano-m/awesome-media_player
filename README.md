# Media Player controls for the Awesome Window Manager with Mpris and DBus

Use the DBus
[Media Player Remote Interfacing Specification (Mpris)](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/mpris-spec/2.2/)
to control your media player (e.g.[ VLC](https://www.videolan.org/),
[QuodLibet](https://quodlibet.readthedocs.io/)).

# Requirements

In addition to the requirements listed in the `rockspec` file, you will need
the [Awesome Window Manager](https://awesomewm.org) and DBus.

You will also need the DBus headers (`dbus.h`) installed.
For example, Debian and Ubuntu provide the DBus headers with the `libdbus-1-dev`
package, Fedora, RedHad and CentOS provide them with the `dbus-devel` package,
while Arch provides them (alongside the binaries) with the `libdbus` package.

# Installation

## Using Luarocks

Probably, the easiest way to install this widget is to use `luarocks`:

    luarocks install media_player

You can use the `--local` option if you don't want or can't install
it system-wide

This will ensure that all its dependencies are installed.

### A note about ldbus

This module depends on the [`ldbus`](https://github.com/daurnimator/ldbus)
module that provides the low-level DBus bindings

    luarocks install --server=http://luarocks.org/manifests/daurnimator \
        ldbus \
        DBUS_INCDIR=/usr/include/dbus-1.0/ \
        DBUS_ARCH_INCDIR=/usr/lib/dbus-1.0/include

As usual, you can use the `--local` option if you don't want or can't install
it system-wide.

## From source

Alternatively, you can copy the `media_player.lua` file in your
`~/.config/awesome` folder. You will have to install all the dependencies
manually though (see the `rockspec` file for more information).

# Usage

Require the `media_player` module in your Awesome configuration file
`~/.config/awesome/rc.lua` and then create a media player interface
for each player that implements the Mpris specification.

When creating a media player with a given `NAME`, the module will
attempt to connect to a DBus destination called `org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.<NAME>`.

A media player is created with

    media_player.MediaPlayer:new(name)

You can create as many players as you want and bind them to different keys.

If you want to display information about the current track, you can use the
`metadata` or `info` methods to extract it and then use it e.g. with Awesome's
[`naughty.notify`](https://awesomewm.org/doc/api/modules/naughty.html#notify).

## An example

For example:

    local media_player = require("media_player")
    local quodlibet = media_player.MediaPlayer:new("quodlibet")
    local vlc =  media_player.MediaPlayer:new("vlc")

Then you can bind the keys:

    awful.util.table.join(
      -- QuodLibet bound to the media keys
      awful.key({}, "XF86AudioPlay", function () quodlibet:play() end),
      awful.key({}, "XF86AudioStop", function () quodlibet:stop() end),
      awful.key({}, "XF86AudioPrev", function () quodlibet:previous() end),
      awful.key({}, "XF86AudioNext", function () quodlibet:next() end),
      -- modkey + i shows useful information from QuodLibet
      awful.key({modkey}, "i", function ()
          local info = quodlibet:info()
          naughty.notify({title=info.title, text=info.album})
      end)
      -- VLC bound to modkey + media keys
      awful.key({modkey}, "XF86AudioPlay", function () vlc:play() end),
      awful.key({modkey}, "XF86AudioStop", function () vlc:stop() end),
      awful.key({modkey}, "XF86AudioPrev", function () vlc:previous() end),
      awful.key({modkey}, "XF86AudioNext", function () vlc:next() end)
    )

Since Awesome calls the functions without passing the object as first parameter,
we must wrap the call to the object's methods in an anonymous function.
